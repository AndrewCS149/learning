# JavaScript Expressions, Operators & Functions

---

### Expressions

An **expression** is something that results to a single value.

### Operators

There are six types of operators:

- Assignment `var name = "Andrew";`
- Arithmetic `var num = 5 + 10;`
- String `var hello = "hi " + "Andrew";`
- Comparison `var num = 5 > 6;`
- Logical `var expression = (5 < 4) && (4 > 2);`

### Functions

A **function** is a way to store code and call that stored code at any point in time. This allows developers to not have to code out redundant code and allows for reusability.

There are both **user-defined** functions and **built-int** functions. A user-defined function is defined by the developer and can be defined in any way the user desires. A built-in function is a function that is _built-in_ to the language itself. This includes functions such as `.write` and `.toLowerCase` and `prompt`.
