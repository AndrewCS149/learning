# How Computers Work

### What makes a computer a computer?

All computers have four things in common. They preform these actions in a row:

- **Input**
- **Store**
- **Process**
- **Output**

| input             | store                    | process                              | output             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Data is receieved | Data is stored in memory | Data is manipulated and stored again | Data is pushed out |

### Binary

At it's base level, a computer represents all data by 1's and 0's.
A bit is the smallest piece of data a computer can store.
As humans use the decimal system to count, a computer uses the binary system to store data. All data is represented by 1's and 0's, even sound, images and videos.

### Memory, CPU, Input and Output

There are mulitiple different input methods. Touch, sound, text or video, are all examples of methods of input. When data is inputed, the CPU (central processing unit) processes and stores that data.

### Hardware & Software

The hardware is the physical aspects of a computer. The software is the different applications that is stored in the computer.

#### How does the hardware and software work together?

The CPU contains different commands that perform different actions, such as an _addition_ command. When data is inputted (from a software application), the CPU (hardware) determines which command to run.

The **operating system** is the _master_ program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
