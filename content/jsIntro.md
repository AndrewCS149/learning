### What is JavaScript used for?

JavaScript enables rich, user interactivity to a web browser. This can contain anything from triggering events when a button is pressed, to populating alert messages on the screen.

### Implementing JavaScript

Like CSS, JavaScript is can be linked to page either **internally** or **externally**. Instead of using a `<link>` tag for external linking, JavaScript requires a `<script>` tag. Example is as follows:

`<script src="index.js"></script>`

Within the **src** tag is the relative file path to the JavaScript file.
