# Operators & Loops

---

### Logical Operators

- `== : equal to`
- `=== : strict equal to`
- `!= :not equal to`
- `!== :strict not equal to`
- `< :less than`
- `> :greater than`
- `<= :less than or equal to`
- `>= :greater than or equal to`
- `! :not equal to`

### Loops: For and While loops

For loop syntax:

`for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {`
`document.write(i);`
`}`

While loop syntax:

`while(i < 10) {`
`document.write(i);`
`i++;`
`}`

**How to know when to use a _for_ or a _while_ loop?**
When the number of iteration to be done is known, then a for loop should be used. If the number of iterations can not be anticipated, then a while loop should be used. A while loop will loop through it's code block until an expression evaluates to false.
