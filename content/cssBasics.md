### What is CSS used for?

It is used to give style to a webpage. CSS 'targets' HTML elements to give that specific element a sepecifed style. A CSS rule contains a **selector** and a **declaration**. The selecter identifies which HTML element to target. The declaration descibes what style to give to that element. 

Each declaration contains both a **property** and a **value**. The property describes what the style is, such as color. The value describes what the styling choice is; the color is *blue*.

Example:

`h1 { color: blue; }`

selector | declaration | property | value
--- | --- | --- | ---
`h1` | `{color: blue;}` | `color:` | `blue;`

Here is a short list of a few of the different properties that are available within CSS.

* `color:`
* `background-color:`
* `background-image:`
* `font-family`
* `font-weight:`
* `margin:`
* `border-color:`
* `width:`

### CSS

There are three different ways that CSS can interpret color values:

* **RGB** (red, green, blue) **Values**
* **Hex Codes** (hexadecimal)
* **Color Names** (red, green, blue, black, etc.)

Red, green, and blue values range from 0 - 255, inclusivel.
