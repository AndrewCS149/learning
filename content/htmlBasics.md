# **HTML Basics**

  ## Wireframes
  Before creating a website, it is best practice to draw a *wireframe* of each page on the website. A wireframe is a simple layout, whether drawn by hand or using a computer software, of the page that is being created. 
  
  Wireframes help the creator visualize the page and understand what needs to be done in order to meet the page objectives.

## HTML 
HTML is a *markup language* that is used to create a website. Every website on the internet uses this markup language to create a foundation. 

 H | T | M | L

 hyper | text | markup | language

 HTML **elements** are used to create a specific meaning to the targeted text. Elements have *opening* and *closing* tags. 

 There are five versions of HTML. In code 102, **HTML5** is used. 

 HTML 5 allows a page to be broken down into many different specific sections. These sections, or elements (as defined above) define the layout of the HTML page. 

## Extra Markup
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag tells the browser that HTML5 is being used.

The `<meta>` element allows the creator to supply the browser additional information about the page.

The `<iframe>` tag is used to create a *cut out window* of another page.
