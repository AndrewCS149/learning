# **Git.**

---

Version Control is a software that allows users to save multiple *versions* of the same project. Users can also track changes, who made the changes and when the changes were applied. 

### There are three different types of version control systems.

* ### **Local Version Control** 
* ### **Centralized Version Control** 
* ### **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**

## What exactly is Git?

Git is a DVCS that tracks the changes, or *commits*, to a project. Every time a commit is *pushed* to the project, Git takes a snapshot of the version, thus creating multiple versions of the same project. 

Git mainly relies on local content, rather than committing changes while online. This allows users to work offline. 

Data loss is much harder to achieve while working with Git.

## There are three *states* that data holds while working with Git. 
* ### **Committed**
* ### **Modified**
* ### **Staged**

## Setting up a repo:

There are two methods when intially setting up a repository:

* **Importing** - Import exisiting, local files.
* **Cloning** - Create repo on Github and clone to local machine.
